# WeatherForcast
# project Summary
1. What I Did
    I built a weather application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS with the following key features:
    A city input form with temperature unit selection (°C or °F)
    An API call to fetch weather data when the user clicks search
    A spinner/loading indicator during the fetch
    An animated weather display section that shows:
    Current weather icon & temperature
    3–5 day forecast
    Toggleable units
    Favorite city save/load
    Conditional UI that switches between input and display
    Click outside to reset view to input
    Optimized image loading and smooth transitions

2. Why I did
    This project was designed to:
    Practice React state management and Next.js routing/layout structure
    Learn how to consume external APIs responsibly (headers, keys, error handling)
    Build an interactive UI using Tailwind CSS
    Apply best practices like:
    Accessibility
    Lazy loading
    Performance optimizations (e.g., next/image)

3. How it Help
This project helped me:
    Strengthen my frontend development skills
    Understand asynchronous data fetching and UI feedback loops (like loading states)
    Improve UI/UX through animation, layout switching, and user-centric design
    Work with localStorage to persist preferences (favorite city)
    Prepare for real-world scenarios like:
        API integration
        Responsive UI states
        State-driven conditional rendering
